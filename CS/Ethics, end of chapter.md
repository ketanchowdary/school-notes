### 9.3.1 A
Free (or *libre*) software is where users are legally permitted to run, copy, change, and adapt any parts of the software.

On the other hand, one is not legally allowed to modify/adapt the source code due to copyright restrictions. It is often not possible to view the source code of freeware.

### 9.3.1 B
When downloading shareware or free software, computer ethics can affect a user because they set boundaries on what the user can and cannot do with the programs they are downloading.

### 9.3.1 C
Firstly, the user night not have access to all parts of the program they recieve for free- and might have to pay additional amounts to "unlock" other features, or use the software before a set free trial period. Moreover, the user is not free to distribute the software without the consent of the software manufacturer.

### 9.3.2
Through freeware, the user is free to use, share, and modify any part of the program (the *source code*) to adapt the program as they wish- this differs from freeware and shaerware, where, due to copyright restrictions, the user is not allowed to modify the program's code.

Free software has an emphasis on libetry, as opposed to profit, and users don't have to pay for additional features/unlocking after trial periods, unlike shareware.
