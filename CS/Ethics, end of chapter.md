### 9.3.1 A
Free (or *libre*) software is where users are legally permitted to run, copy, change, and adapt any parts of the software.

On the other hand, one is not legally allowed to modify/adapt the source code due to copyright restrictions. It is often not possible to view the source code of freeware.

### 9.3.1 B
When downloading shareware or free software, computer ethics can affect a user because they set boundaries on what the user can and cannot do with the programs they are downloading.

### 9.3.1 C
Firstly, the user night not have access to all parts of the program they recieve for free- and might have to pay additional amounts to "unlock" other features, or use the software before a set free trial period. Moreover, the user is not free to distribute the software without the consent of the software manufacturer.
