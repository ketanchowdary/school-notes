## City parts in need of repair.

 A recent temporary shutdown of the "Sammy's Place" hostel in the Eastern side of the city by the sanitation department took place yesterday.

The request for an inspection comes from the mother of an 18-year-old- Mrs. Wilkie, after booking a room online at the hostel, only to be shocked that it was nothing like the description online- and to their surprise, poor economic conditions had led to their daughter, Sacha, being forced to stay there during her Gap year.

When one enters the vicinity, they are greeted by an abundance of rats- thriving in the unmaintained streets off of the trash from the hostel and nearby buildings. Journeying through the uncut grass, I found the building- an old, rundown building with cracked walls, paint that is falling apart, and a terrible smell.

Upon further inspection, it was observed that the hostel was in completely unlivable conditions- there waere bags full of trash on the inside to deal with the rats, the lights flickered due to unstable electricity, and there was no ventilation whatsoever thanks to the windows being shut.

"I cannot believe that these youngsters are having to go through these conditions- it's the worst!" says Mrs Wilkie, and the hostel has since been temporarily shut down for maintenance. The corresponding government agencies have been notified of the problems in the area.

"Hopefully we'll be able to make this a better place", said Jed, the manager of the hostel, promising to comply with the authorities to fix up the hostel. The maintenance of other buildings in this area will now be regularly monitored and action will be taken for any broken regulations.
