### NOTES: 

#### Part 1: what makes lyuba so remarkable:

- Only a handful were ever discovered.
- discovered accidentally.
- "most perfectly preserved".
- wasn't sold or disturbed.
- scientists were able to carefully preserve the remains

#### Part 2: what scientists hope to understand:

- how she died.
- what pleistocene life was like
- info about climate change
- mammoths' DNA and more info about mammoths
- where she came from.

### Answer:

Out of the handful of organisms every discovered from the Ice ages, the newly found Mammoth Lyuba proved to be remarkable- as 40,000 years in freezing cold conditions led to the dead mammoth being a perfectly preserved ice age animal.

Furthermore, the herder who discovered the body neither dug up, nor sold the dead remains of the accidentally-discovered mammoth, choosing instead to contact authorities to begin the retrieval of the untouched body.

Scientists are currently analyzing the body to find out the secrets surrounding the mammoth, and how she died. They also hope to use the data they find to understand more about what the conditions in the Pleistocene ages were like, and how much the climate has changed.
