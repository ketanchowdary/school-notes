Thank you all for coming here to listen to my speech. Before I start, I would like to ask an open question to every member of the audience here- how much would you like it for someone else to take the decisions in you life? Would you be okay with that?

As many of you may have known, our school forms a glaring exception to what is now considered the hallmark of any good school- the student council. 

As a student who is willing to take great responsibility (and with it, great power) over my own school life- I think that our school shou

Students, teachers, and parents have mixed opinions when it comes to whether or not a student council has to exist- while on one hand, it's empowering one and letting them act independently for the first time in their life, but on the other- are students qualified to take important decisions for the school?

It makes sense that many are skeptical about the qualifications of 14- or 15-year-old kids in the handling of what is essentially a very real business with very real stakes- a bad decision can potentially damage the reputation of the entire school for years to come. 

And even if there are no terrible decisions made, the council naturally disadvantages students by taking time out of theiir schedules which could otherwise be used for practiec more in line with their academic aspirations- right?

Therefore, it seems like the best option is to rely on the opinions, abilities, and assumptions of our teachers- the same teachers that might or might not completely understand the students' specefic issues, the same teachers whose educational assumptions could be outdated and possibly entirely out of the rpesent reality- doesn't it?

I think it's easy to see the problem from that- there's really no one that can understand the problems of the current student body other than... the current student body.

It is with this in mind, that I am proposing today, that our school should begin student council, elected by the student body- to take up actually important decions- not just merely approving or suggesting edits to existing changes- we need a student council capable of making real, effective changes, otherwise, there is no point to having a student council al all!

Studies have shown that student particiation is extremely essential to promote a better perception of the school to students, particularly younger ones- as it pushes the idea that they aren't experiencing the effects of someone else's arbitrary decisions.
