The recent broadcast about peopleâ€™s attitudes to animals raised important issues. 

The broadcast made the arguments that many animal conservationists prioritize animal lives over those of humans- and that many people calling for the conservation of animal lives are not seeing the big picture. 

While the broadcast made a few good arguments, I find it disturbing that such arguments about an important and relevant topic are based on such a misplaced premise.

Simply put, while yes, there is room for improvement in the way some conservationists put forth their arguments, I find the stance that we needn't care about animal populations just because zoos exist utterly detached from reality, and not to mention extremely irresponsible.

In reality, animals deserve to be conserved not (just) because we are taking a romantic or exaggerated cultural stance, but really because owe it to the animals' safety!

Humanity's protections of animals means not that humanity is interfering after extinction happens naturally, but that the interference had already happened- which is what causes near-extinction conditions in the first place, and we are merely trying to correct the mistakes made in the past.

And yes, it may not make sense that in history there have existed that some ready to sacrifice human lives for an animal- but maybe the real problem is the humans being there in the first place.

Therefore, I think it makes perfect sense that humans take up conservation efforts, that humans speak for our mute friends, that humans understand the bounds of their property. For when we have trespassed and caused damage in someone else's house, the least we can do is help them fix it.
