Question 2 [Journal Entry]:

Last night, I had a very strange experience. I had found myself lost in the far north, and had nowhere to go but forward, thanks to the snow and, with no other choice, I decided to keep moving forward- while the snowfall thickened. 
The remnants of the sunlight had faded into complete darkness, and my attempts at finding any trace of human activity had failed- at this point, I was becoming increasingly paranoid.
I remembered my promise to my wife- that I would be back before the sun sets- and tales of lost travelers I kept screaming, each time louder than before, to try and find anyone who would find my presence, before finally finding an old man with a lantern.

I was overjoyed to finally find someone, and that I wasn't completely lost, but the man did not share the same feelings- he seemed annoyed, and my desperation only seemed to annoy him more. I followed him to his house, a lonely, deserted hut in on the side of a hill. 
I was extremely annoyed that my only hope of surviving this night wasn't very co-operative, but I didn't stop trying. After repeated pleading, the man agreed to let me stay for one night at his house. After entering the house, a wave of relief swept over me, it was as though I experienced warmth for the first time in a century, I finally felt like myself for the first time in the day.

The man offered me some food, while it was no remarkable dish, I was still more than grateful for the first meal since breakfast. The man seemed less annoyed than before, showed me where I could sleep- a cozy, warm room with a small bed. I thanked the man once again, and went to sleep. Today was a long day, and I can't wait to return home!
