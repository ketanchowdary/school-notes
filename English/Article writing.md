## How (and how not) to use humor in the workplace.

Humor is widely considered a good thing, its benefits are numerous and it immensely useful in the workplace. Whether showing new employees how important fun is at the workplace, boosting morale, and boosting productivity by making workers more motivated. 

It makes sense, then, that 75% workers are reluctant to leave fun workplace, or that 90% of executives are more likely to promote someone with a better sense of humor (NOTE: add more points on the benefits of humor in the workplace here).

However, humor is neither timeless not universal- there is no single joke that can make anyone laugh at any time. This creates interesting conditions for humor and make it a double-edged sword. Some may find certain jokes offensive, and some just plain unfunny. How does one navigate this maze?

Obviously, it's easy to see how humor can be a stress-reliever in periods of intense pressure. However, it could be argued that at the same time, being at the receiving end of these jokes could cause just as much stress as they alleviate.
The same good/bad dichotomy goes for every characteristic of humor in the workplace. For instance, while it makes work less boring, by promoting cheer and joy- it could also make work scary, and make workers paranoid that they can be the subject of these jokes- does that strike you as ideal?

So it's set then, it's officially time to get rid of jokes altogether, because fun is bad- time to ban fun, right? Wrong. Just focusing on the negatives ignores the fact that a dull, humorless office is no good either. Really, the middle path is the best one.

In order to make a joke that is more likely to go along well with your colleagues, ensure that the jokes are not based on social issues, and that there's no trace of prejudice in any of the words you choose to make. These jokes are completely inappropriate- and no justification can erase the effects they can create on your image.

Secondly, keep in mind that no matter how sane something can seem to you, your jokes always have the potential to go wrong- keep in mind that apologizing in a scenario like this is not an admission of your weakness, but a show of your strength.

To summarize; jokes are risky- they have the potential to create a massively better work environment, but a misunderstanding of the lines of humor has the exact opposite effect.
