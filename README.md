## The Notes
These are surya's (and others') notes since a few days- all in markdown files, take if you want!

The raw files and material is in the "Repository management stuff" folder, along with logs of everyones contributions and subject-wise segeregation.

The revision timetable and class timetable are also available. However, the class timetable is missing english classes from 0800 to 0900 on weekday except Tuesday.

More stuff is always being added, and it is appreciated if you can commit more notes to the repo!

Clone the repository and open the school-notes folder as a vault using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to view everything- like the embedded images, PDFs, etc. (Otherwise, look into the "Repository management stuff" folder for the raw files.)

Happy preparing!

Surya.
